                            <h2>RCIA and RCIC</h2>
                            <p class="biography">Each year, many people come to a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ through the Catholic Church. The RICA process here at St. Francis provides a personal, gentle, guided journey for those adults wishing to learn more about and join in full communion with the Church as new members or people seeking to return to the church. The modern RICA is modeled after the Catechumenate practices of the early Church when adults who sought entry proceeded through various stages of growth and formation.</p>

                            <p class="biography"> Here at St. Francis, our Catechumens meet each Wednesday at 7:30pm for 90 minutes from mid-September thru just after Easter. In these meetings, which are led by priests, deacons, and members of our parish community, Catechumens share prayer and faith experiences, and study Church teachings, traditions and beliefs. In addition to meetings, there are periodic liturgical rites which are celebrated as the Catechumen proceeds to an understanding of faith and love as future Catholic men and women. The members of our RCIA team of priests, deacons, and lay people want to help you answer the question: "To what may God be calling you?"</p>

                            <p class="biography">In 1988 the Catholic Bishops of the United States directed that adults wishing to become Catholics do so as set forth in the RICA process. The process stresses the connection between the three sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist. At the annual Easter Vigil mass, the elect (adults who have completed the process and make the decision to become Catholic) are welcomed into the church with the reception of these sacraments of initiation.</p>
