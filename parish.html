                                    <p class="biography"><strong>Father Michael "Mick" O'Neill</strong> was born December 15, 1940 in County Wexford, Ireland, the second oldest of four children. Elementary schooling took place in the local National school; secondary education followed in St. Michael's College, County Louth, a boarding school operated by the Rosminian Fathers. He entered the Rosminian Novitate in 1957, and after two years was sent to University College in Cork to study for BA and Higher Diploma in Education. Final profession of vows in the Rosminian Institute took place in 1962. After three years of teaching and discipline at St. Michael's, he proceeded to the Rosminian International Seminary in Porta Latina, Rome, where he completed his priestly studies.</p> 
                                    <p class="biography">Fr Mick was ordained priest by Cardinal John Wright of Pittsburgh in Rome on February 20, 1970. For the next eleven years, he was involved in teaching and discipline, both in St. Joseph's Blind School, Dublin, and in St. Michael's College, his alma mater. A sabbatical year followed (1981-82), after which he was assigned directorship of St. Joseph's Blind School until Summer 1989. Thereafter began his various assignments overseas: Sacred Heart Parish, Bradenton, FL (1989-91), Rosminian Spirituality Center, Peoria, IL (1991-93), master of seminarians, Porta Latina, Rome (1993-95), and then returning to Sacred Heart, Bradenton, FL (1995-98). Summer 1998 saw him once more back home as pastor of St. Oliver's Parish, Clonmel, County Tipperary. After two years he experienced health problems that forced him into treatment and temporary leave-of-absence for a full year. Now, restored to health and vigor, he joins the pastoral team at St. Francis of Assisi Parish, Seffner, Fl.</p>

                                    <p class="biography"><strong>Father Christopher R. Fitzgerald</strong> was born on January 3, 1932 in Ballyporeen, in County Tipperary, Ireland. He is the youngest of 11 children. Father Fitzgerald attended the Local National School in Ballyporeen until 1945, when he transferred to Presentation College, which is operated by the Irish Christian Brothers. Father Fitzgerald’s early studies for the priesthood were at the Rosminian Seminary in Diano Marina, Italy, and continued at the Rosminian International College at Porta Latina, Rome. Father Fitzgerald graduated from the Pontifical University of St. John Lateran in Rome and was ordained to the priesthood on December 7, 1958. After spending a short period as a Seminary teacher in Ireland, Father Fitzgerald was reassigned to Florida, where he has remained since May 1960.</p>
                                    <p class="biography">Father Fitzgerald is a member of the religious order known as the Institute of Charity, founded by Antonio Rosmini in 1839. Members of the Institute of Charity are commonly referred to as "Rosminians" after their founder. The Institute takes its name from "charity" and consists of faithful Christians who wish to fulfill as perfectly as possible the Lord’s own precept to love God above all things and their neighbor as themselves. The Institute of Charity is comprised of four major provinces worldwide: the Italian Province which includes the regions of India and Venezuela; the English Province which includes the region of New Zealand; the Irish Province which includes the Vice Province of Africa; and the United States Province. Father Fitzgerald was appointed Provincial Superior for the Institute of Charity’s United States Province in 1995.</p>
                                    <p class="biography">In 1960 Father Fitzgerald was assigned to Blessed Sacrament Parish, which is located in Seminole, near St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, Florida. Father spent 11 years at Blessed Sacrament before being reassigned as Pastor at St. Charles Borromeo Parish in Port Charlotte, Florida. Two years later, at the personal request of Bishop Charles McLaughlin, Father Fitzgerald was reassigned as Pastor of St. Anne’s Parish in Ruskin, Florida, where he was asked to develop a Migrant Ministry as part of the parish. Father Fitzgerald spent 15 years at St. Anne’s, having learned Spanish and Creole, ministering to the needs of the migrant families and Haitians living in that area. In 1987 Father Fitzgerald received another personal request, this time from Bishop Thomas Larkin, Bishop of the Diocese of St. Petersburg. Bishop Larkin asked Father Fitzgerald if he would consider starting a brand new parish in the small east Hillsborough County community of Seffner. So it was that St. Francis of Assisi was born. From its humble beginnings in a small storefront in a strip mall, to the beautiful parish grounds located on 20 acres on County Road 579 in Seffner.</p>
                                    <p class="biography"> Father Fitzgerald has served obediently under four Bishops in the Diocese of St. Petersburg. In the spirit of Rosminian obedience he has accepted his assignments with enthusiasm and joy, and in doing so he has found moments of deepest grace. Father Fitzgerald is currently the Diocesan Director of Rural Life Ministries and serves on the Board of Trustees of Catholic Charities in the Diocese of St. Petersburg. He is the former Vicar Forane (Dean) for the east Hillsborough County’s 13 parishes, 33 priests and 9 permanent Deacons. Although Father Fitzgerald turned 68 in this year of 2000, slowing down or retirement does not seem to be on his agenda.</p>

In 1988, Jerry entered formation and training for the second diaconate class of the Diocese of St. Petersburg and was ordained to the diaconate on June 6, 1991.  At that time he was assigned to St. Francis of Assisi Parish in Seffner Florida where he remains today. As an ordained deacon and member of the clergy Deacon Jerry  serves  in sacramental preparation, witnesses the exchange of marriage vows, administers the sacrament of Baptism, is an instructor in the parish RCIA program and  preaches and proclaims the Gospel during one of our weekend masses. He also serves as parish manager of St. Francis of Assisi and has been on the parish finance committee since first coming to St. Francis. Although Deacon Jerry and his wife Maggie have retired from their  family business, they are always busy and Deacon Jerry said recently, “I truly thank God for calling me as deacon here at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic parish.”</p>
