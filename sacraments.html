                            <h2>Eucharistic Adoration</h2>
                            <blockquote><strong>Come to Me, all you who labor and are overburdened, and I will give you rest.</strong></blockquote>
                            <p class="biography">Eucharistic Adoration - the act of worshopping God as He is present in the consecrated Eucharist - is the Catholic belief in the real presence of Jesus Christ. During Mass at the consecration, the priest speaks these words as he holds the communion host:</p>
                            <blockquote>"He took bread and gave you thanks. He broke the bread, gave It to His disciples, and said, 'Take this all of you, and eat It: this is My Body whcih will be given up for you.'"</blockquote>
                            <p class="biography">When the priest says, "this is My Body," and "this is My Blood," this is the instant when, through the miracle of transubstantiation, the bread and wine truly become the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. It is His true presence in the form of bread and wine.<em>It is Christ.</em> Here at St. Francis, Eucharistic Adoration occurs when the priest takes a consecrated host and places it in the monstrance. He then places the monstrance in the Adoration Chapel, across the hall from the entrance to the sanctuary.</p>

                            <h2>Join us for Adoration</h2>
                            <p class="biography">Monday through Friday in the Adoration Chapel, after the 8:00am Mass until 4:00pm.

                                    <li><strong>Pour out your heart to Christ and adore Him.</strong> Speak to Jesus and tell Him all that comes to your mind. Listen for His response. Pray the prayer that St. Francis instructed his brothers to pray whenever they were before the Blessed Sacrament: "I adore you, O Christ, present here and in all the churches of the world, for by Your holy cross You have redeemed the world."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ask forgiveness and intercede for others.</strong> Ask God to forgive you for all the times you have neglected or hurt someone else. Bring before the Blessed Sacrament all those who have asked you to pray for them.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pray the Rosary.</strong> Ask Mary to join you as you gaze on Christ in the Eucharist and pray the Rosary.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sit quietly and just be in the presence of God.</strong> Think of a visit to the Blessed Sacrament as coming to see your best friend. Instead of talking to the Lord, try listening to what He wants to tell you.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Recite the "Jesus Prayer."</strong> Repeat, "Lord Jesus, have mercy on me, a sinner," as you quiet your heart and mind.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Meditate using Scripture.</strong> Choose a passage from the Bible, ask God to let the passage speak to you and what He wishes for you to draw from that passage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Read the life of a saint and pray with him or her.</strong> A few saints are: Therese of Lisieux, Catherine of Seina, Francis of Assisi, Thomas Aquinas, Dorothy Day, Teresa of Calcutta.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pray the Psalms or the Liturgy of the Hours.</strong></li>
