                                    Where there is hatred, let me sow love; <br />
                                    Where there is injury, pardon; <br />
                                    Where there is doubt, faith; <br />
                                    Where there is despair, hope; <br />
                                    Where there is darkness, light; <br />
                                    And where there is sadness, joy. <br />
                                    O Divine Master, <br / >
                                    Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; <br />
                                    To be understood as to understand; <br />
                                    To be loved as to love. <br />
                                    For it is in giving that we receive, <br />
                                    It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, <br />
                                    And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life."
