                            <p class="biography">If we are honest with ourselves for one minute, we have to admit we are amazingly blessed. Our lives are not without disappointments and struggles. Still the very fact that we live in a country so abundant with life and liberty makes the pursuit of our dreams possible. It is God who is the source of these gifts.</p>
                            
                            <p class="biography">It is important to recognize that we are dependent on God for all our gifts. How we respond to the challenge is crucial. Pope Benedict XVI offers guidance in this encyclical, Charity in Truth: "As the objects of God's love, men and women become subjects of charity, they are called to make themselves instruments of grace, so as to pour forth God's charity and to weave networks of charity" (5).</p>

                            <h2>Legion of Mary</h2>
                            <div class="biography" class='content_block_inner'>
                                <p> The Legion of Mary welcomes all active Catholics interested in offering their services for spiritual work as needed by our pastor, Father Fitzgerald. Under the banner of Mary, and with her help, we endeavor to become holy in our own lives and spread a deeper devotion to her.</p>
                                <p>The Legion was founded by Frank Duff and began in Dublin, Ireland in 1921. It now encompasses more than three million members in nearly one thousand dioceses throughout the world. The first Praesidium (parish unit) was founded in the United States in 1931. At St. Francis of Assisi, Our Lady Queen of Peace Praesidium was founded in 1987. We currently have 19 active members and 95 auxiliary members.</p>

                                    <ul>

                                        <li> Spread devotion to Mary primarily by encouraging the recitation of the Rosary, as Mary requested at Fatima.</li>
                                        <li> Performance of apostolic work under the Spiritual Direction of the parish unit by Deacon Jerry Thomas.</li>
