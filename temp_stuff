    <p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
    Where there is hatred, let me sow love.<br>
    Where there is injury, pardon.<br>
    Where there is doubt, faith.<br>
    Where there is despair, hope.<br>
    Where there is darkness, light.<br>
    Where there is sadness, joy.<br>
    O Divine Master,<br>
    grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console;<br>
    to be understood, as to understand;<br>
    to be loved, as to love.<br>
    For it is in giving that we receive.<br>
    It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br>
    and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.<br>
        Amen.</p>
