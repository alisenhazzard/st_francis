                            <strong>March 22 to 24, 2013</strong>
                                <blockquote>"...it was at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians." (Acts 11:26)</blockquote>
                            <p class="biography">Antioch Retreat is open to all teens and young adults (13+ or 9th grade+) of all faiths. The weekend is led by Teens for Teens in the true spirit of peer ministry. Antioch 2013 will be our 15th year holding the retreat.</p>
                            <p class="biography">The process and general format of the retreat are similar to many Christian weekend and community experiences. It is a Christian, spirit-filled weekend dealing with issues that young people face today. There is a balance of fun, music, sharing, learning, and testimonies. The basic dynamic involves the Spirit of the Lord moving among good young people as they search for God.   
                            <p class="biography">We begin on Friday and end with Mass on Sunday at 7:00pm. All food, lodging, and supervision is provided. The cost is $75.00, with scholarships available for those with financial need.</p>

                                <h2>Religious Education</h2>
                                <p class="biography"> At St. Francis, Religious Education is viewed as faith formation for our children from pre-K through 12th grade. We hope to provide experiences of learning and growing for all members of the parish, young and old. Our parish is one centered around family, and it is in the parish that people are nurtured, educated, guided, and inspired.</p>
                                <p class="biography">This year, we have embarked on a new venture in our faith formation program: "We Believe", a program for <strong>pre-K through 6th grade</strong>. It offes a complete catechetical curriculum, including a textbook for each student, and age-appropriate teaching styles. The program involves parents and families with child-initiated prayer and activities that apply to family life. Both the texts and catechetical guides conform to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.</p>
                                <p class="biography">The curriculum for <strong>7th and 8th grades</strong> includes the text, "One Faith, One Lord." 7th grade concentration is on "Introduction to the New Testament", and 8th grade focuses on "Liturgy and Worship". These offerings are based on adolescent catechesis, motivating our young people to continue the adventure of deepening their Catholic faith.</p>
                                <p class="biography"><strong>Grades 9-12th and above (Senior Youth Group)</strong> offer an active and challenging opportunity for our high school students to be integrated into the whole faith community. Discussions on vocations, abstinence, current events, relationships, and peer ministries are included in weekly meetings. Guest speakers, video and internet resources are introduced at these sessions. Leadership is encouraged and our young adults are empowered to answer God's call to be disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
